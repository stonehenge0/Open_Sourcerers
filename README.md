# ApplePy
Repository for the Group Project in Programming for Data Scientists. 

# Data
If you research charities to fit the categories of the original GiveWell table that Emma provided please put them in this file: "231223_ApplePy_data.ods" :)

# Website
All the files for the website are uploaded :)
For an **introduction to how the website works**, you can look into the Etherpad. There is also a "Flask_Playground" file, where a backend for a very small website is running, that you can play around with. (If something doesn't work, you might need to change filepaths, they are still in the form from when they were on my local computer)

## GitHub pages 
[![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/stonehenge0/Open_Sourcerers/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stonehenge0/Open_Sourcerers/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

The website is generated from the content in the `docs/` folder and reachable under the url: [https://stonehenge0.github.io/Open_Sourcerers/](https://stonehenge0.github.io/Open_Sourcerers/). 

Once changes to the `docs/` folder are made, the website builds again automatically. 

You can see the current build status, as well as previous builds in the `Actions` tab of the repository, or by clicking on the symbol next to where the last commit shown (shows as a little ✖️ or ✔️). Clicking the symbol and then `Details` will lead you to an overview of the current build where you can also run the build again without needing to modify the files in `docs/` by clicking on `Re-run all jobs` in the top right. 

You can change the setup so that the website is generated from the root of the repository instead in `settings` > `pages`. An `index.html` file needs to be present in the root directory for the site to be displayed correctly.
