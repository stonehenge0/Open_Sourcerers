# ApplePy
Repository for the Group Project in Programming for Data Scientists. 

# Data
If you research charities to fit the categories of the original GiveWell table that Emma provided please put them in this file: "231223_ApplePy_data.ods" :)

# Website
All the files for the website are uploaded :)
For an **introduction to how the website works**, you can look into the Etherpad. There is also a "Flask_Playground" file, where a backend for a very small website is running, that you can play around with. (If something doesn't work, you might need to change filepaths, they are still in the form from when they were on my local computer)
