Repository for the Group Project in Programming fro Data Scientists. 

are we supposed to post our project ideas right here, or how does this work?
anyway i guess i will just post my idea here.

Project proposal

Website/Desktop app to help learning math

Data source:
    collecting a Dataset of mathematical formular for the grades 7-13 using a web crawler and for each formular 2-3 exercises to practice and learn the formular
    
Data storage and handling:
    storing the mathematical formulars and exercises in a database system like SQL or MongoDB
    programming a code that makes sure that no passwords of the users are shown as a plain text on the website/desktop app
     
User account management system:
      programming a code that allows the user to create an account by giving their name. After the user gave their name he is allowed to choose a username and create a password wich allows the user to log in on the 
      website/Desktop app
      programming a code that ,everytime a new person creates an account, generates a user_id.
      The information of the name, username, password and user_id will be stored in a database
      
interactive web/user interface:

creating a graphical user interface as a web interface 

on that web interface their will be four buttons
                     - one help button to contact the admin directly to help him with the exercises
                     - one button named "mathematical library" where the user is able to click on his 
                       requested grades, which than moves him to a library containing all 
                       mathematical formulars that are relevant in this grade
                     - one button name exercises where the user is able to click on his requested 
                       grade which than moves him to a library containing all exercises that require 
                       mathematical formulars from this grade.
                     - one button named statistics  that shows the "progress" of the user on a chart
                     (progress might mean how many exercises did he already solve of this specific 
                      grade. how long did he take. how many attempts did he need. stuff like that)
