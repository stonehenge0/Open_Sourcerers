## GitHub pages/ Website
[![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/stonehenge0/Open_Sourcerers/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stonehenge0/Open_Sourcerers/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

The website is generated from the content in the `docs/` folder and reachable under the url: [https://stonehenge0.github.io/Open_Sourcerers/](https://stonehenge0.github.io/Open_Sourcerers/). 

Once changes to the `docs/` folder are made, the website builds again automatically. 

You can see the current build status, as well as previous builds in the `Actions` tab of the repository, or by clicking on the symbol next to where the last commit shown (shows as a little ✖️ or ✔️). Clicking the symbol and then `Details` will lead you to an overview of the current build where you can also run the build again without needing to modify the files in `docs/` by clicking on `Re-run all jobs` in the top right. 

You can change the setup so that the website is generated from the root of the repository instead in `settings` > `pages`. An `index.html` file needs to be present in the root directory for the site to be displayed correctly.
