## GitHub pages/ Website
[![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/stonehenge0/Open_Sourcerers/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stonehenge0/Open_Sourcerers/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

The website is generated from the content in the `docs/` folder and reachable under the url: [https://stonehenge0.github.io/Open_Sourcerers/](https://stonehenge0.github.io/Open_Sourcerers/). 

Once changes to the `docs/` folder are made, the website builds again automatically. 

You can see the current build status, as well as previous builds in the `Actions` tab of the repository, or by clicking on the symbol next to where the last commit shown (shows as a little ✖️ or ✔️). Clicking the symbol and then `Details` will lead you to an overview of the current build where you can also run the build again without needing to modify the files in `docs/` by clicking on `Re-run all jobs` in the top right. 

You can change the setup so that the website is generated from the root of the repository instead in `settings` > `pages`. An `index.html` file needs to be present in the root directory for the site to be displayed correctly. 

#  How to use this file
We ask all students working on projects and theses with us to 
* hand in their source code and
* provide a documentation for their project. 

Source code (including the code architecture and comments) has to adhere to our [developer guidelines](https://isgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/STUD/pages/1409184/Developer+Guidelines). The project documentation consists of one or more a `README.md` files that cover the topics listed hereafter. Thus, copy this file's content to your project and use it as a template to write the documentation for your project.

Aside from using this template, also check out the following sources for examples and guidelines on how to write a good `README.md` for your project. Note that the exemplary projects do not follow this template completely (either because they were created by third-parties or before we consolidated all the information into this template). They are still good examples of high-quality `README.md` files.
* [Example: news-please](https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please/blob/master/README.md)
* [Article: How to write a good readme](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project)
* [Article: A beginners guide to writing a good readme](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)

---
## Project title
A short description of the project’s purpose and main functionality. **What** does the project do?

## Motivation
A short description of the project’s motivation. **Why** does the project exist, and which issues does it address?
 
## Features
What makes your project stand out? Include screenshots, code snippets, logos, etc.

## Code examples
Include **very short code examples** that show what the project does as **concisely** as possible. Developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code examples. Make sure the API you are showing off is intuitive, and that your code is short and concise. See the [news-please project](https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please/blob/master/README.md#use-within-your-own-code-as-a-library) for example.

## Installation
Provide step-by-step examples and descriptions of how to set up a development environment.

## API reference
For small projects with a simple enough API, include the reference docs in this README. For medium-sized and larger projects, provide a link to the API reference docs.

## Tests (optional: only if you have tests)
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use and extend the project? (maybe)
Include a step-by-step guide that enables others to use and extend your code for their projects. Whether this section is required and whether it should be part of the `README.md` or a separate file depends on your project. If the **very short** `Code Examples` from above comprehensively cover (despite being concise!) all the major functionality of your project already, this section can be omitted. **If you think that users/developers will need more information than the brief code examples above to fully understand your code, this section is mandatory.** If your project requires significant information on code reuse, place the information into a new `.md` file.

## Results
If you performed evaluations as part of your project, include your preliminary results that you also show in your final project presentation, e.g., precision, recall, F1 measure and/or figures highlighting what your project does. If applicable, briefly describe the dataset your created or used first before presenting the evaluated use cases and the results.

If you are about to complete your thesis, include the most important findings (precision/recall/F1 measure) and refer to the corresponding pages in your thesis document.

## License
Include the project's license. Usually, we suggest MIT or Apache. Ask your supervisor. For example:
